        <h1>Information Architecture as Care Infrastructure</h1>
        <p>F.E.A.S.T. Technology Systems (2020-present)</p>

        <h2>Research Question</h2>
        <p>How does computational mediation transform the experience of seeking help during acute family crisis? When parents need evidence-based guidance for eating disorder treatment, what changes when that information is accessed through database queries and algorithmic curation rather than human conversation or print materials?</p>
        
        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p><strong>Organization:</strong> F.E.A.S.T. (Families Empowered and Supporting Treatment of Eating Disorders)<br>
        <strong>Role:</strong> Director of Technology Services (2020-present)<br>
        <strong>Scale:</strong> ~15,000 families annually accessing information systems during crisis moments</p>
        
        <p>F.E.A.S.T. provides evidence-based guidance to families navigating eating disorder treatment. As sole technical staff, I designed and maintained the computational infrastructure that mediates how parents in acute distress access support.</p>
        
        <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
        
        <h3>Salesforce CRM as Knowledge Architecture</h3>
        <p>Migrated from legacy system to Salesforce, designing data structures that shape how information flows between crisis contact and resource delivery. Key decisions: what gets captured as structured data vs. free text? How do field choices privilege certain kinds of help-seeking over others?</p>
        
        <h3>Dashboard Design for Distributed Decision-Making</h3>
        <p>Created reporting dashboards enabling staff to identify patterns in help-seeking behavior. The dashboard doesn't just display data—it constructs a particular way of "seeing" families in crisis, determining which patterns become visible and actionable.</p>
        
        <h3>Email Marketing as Relationship Medium</h3>
        <p>Designed automated email sequences that maintain connection with families over time. Each technical choice (segmentation logic, timing algorithms, content triggers) shapes how computational systems can "care" at scale.</p>
        
        <h2>Computational Media Analysis</h2>
        
        <h3>What Becomes Visible/Invisible</h3>
        <p>Database architecture determines what aspects of family crisis can be captured, searched, and acted upon. Unstructured emotional content often falls outside system affordances, creating systematic gaps in how computational systems "understand" need.</p>
        
        <h3>Algorithmic Curation of Evidence</h3>
        <p>Search and recommendation systems determine which information families encounter first. This isn't neutral—it encodes assumptions about what constitutes "evidence-based" and whose expertise counts.</p>
        
        <h3>Efficiency vs. Presence</h3>
        <p>Computational systems enable helping at scale but transform the phenomenology of care. What's gained and lost when support moves from synchronous human presence to asynchronous database interaction?</p>
        
        <h2>Metrics & Impact</h2>
        <p><em>[PLACEHOLDER: Response time improvements, information retrieval efficiency, engagement patterns - to be filled]</em></p>
        
        <h2>Theoretical Grounding</h2>
        <p>This work engages with questions of <strong>algorithmic mediation</strong> (how computational systems reshape social practices), <strong>platform affordances</strong> (what actions computational infrastructure makes possible/impossible), and <strong>computational care</strong> (how automated systems can or cannot embody support).</p>
